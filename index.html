      I have always had a passion for Math since i was a young boy, 
            but did not find a passion for computers til Later on. Now I can't stay
            away from them.

    <h1>My Work</h1>


<P>
    I have had a host of Jobs none related to software or its development.
            The closest I have gotten to this area of work would probably be the few Admin
            assistant positions I have had.
